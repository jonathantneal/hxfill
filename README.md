[hxfill] lets you give contextual levels to headings in HTML.

Try it in your browser right now at [CodePen].

```html
<!-- before -->
<body>
<h3>This is a top level heading</h3>
<p>...</p>
<section>
  <p>...</p>
  <h1>This is a second-level heading</h1>
  <p>...</p>
  <h2>This is another second-level heading</h2>
  <p>...</p>
</section>
<section>
  <p>...</p>
  <h3>This is another second-level heading</h3>
  <p>...</p>
  <section>
    <h2>This is a third-level heading</h2>
    <p>...</p>
  </section>
</section>
</body>

<!-- after -->
<body>
<h3 aria-level="1">This is a top level heading</h3>
<p>...</p>
<section>
  <p>...</p>
  <h1 aria-level="2">This is a second-level heading</h1>
  <p>...</p>
  <h2 aria-level="2">This is another second-level heading</h2>
  <p>...</p>
</section>
<section>
  <p>...</p>
  <h3 aria-level="2">This is another second-level heading</h3>
  <p>...</p>
  <section>
    <h2 aria-level="3">This is a third-level heading</h2>
    <p>...</p>
  </section>
</section>
</body>
```

## FAQ

#### Why are different-leveled headings in the same section getting the same level?

[hxfill] only assigns contextual levels according by sectioning container. This
means an `<h2>` and an `<h3>` in same `<section>` receive the same level. This
means the implicit sectioning of headings is lost. This is because itâ€™s unclear
how implicit sectioning works in relationship with explicit sectioning.

Consider the following markup following the document outline:

```html
<h1>This is a top-level H1 heading</h1>
  <p>This is some content elaborating on the H1</p>
  <h2>And this is a slightly lesser H2 heading</h2>
    <p>And this is some content elaborating on the H2</p>
    <aside>
      <h3>And this is an H3 heading probably the same level as the H2</h3>
      <p>Because the aside element ended the implicit section of the H2</p>
    </aside>
    <p>This content either elaborates on the H2, begins a new implicit section, or means nothing</p>
```
